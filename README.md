## :mag: Info
A completely GMO-free neovim configuration written with cross-compatability in mind.
Have you ever wanted an organic typing experience? Try out embervim! We always push
breaking changes and always reconfigure plugins. There is no better experience out there.

This is meant to be used as a baseline for your own configuration! All you have to do
is clone this repo, and smack that `nvim` folder into `~/.config`. Have a configuration
there already? Just go ahead and `rm -rf ~/.config` and you'll be good to go!

**Features**
- LSP
- Autocomplete
- Treesitter/Telescope and other staples
- Lazygit in your editor ðŸ¤—
- Code screenshotting
- Doesn't break on WSL/Windows/Mac/Linux
- Much more!

> P.S. I honestly forgot everything this depends on. I know you will probably need `node`
for some LSPs and `silicon` for code screenshotting. Oh and probably install `lazygit`
if you want to use that. Other than that, if something breaks, my bad.

> P.S. P.S. Cloning this repo is over like 100MBs, so yeah... thats my bad. I may or
may not have stored some large image files here for a showcase once.
