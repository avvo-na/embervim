## Usage
You can clone the repository and run the install script or manually replace your nvim configuration folder with this one.
Make sure to run `install.sh` not `webinstall.sh` as the latter will clone the repostory again.
Alternatively there are simple one line commands below that will run install embervim for you!

*These install scripts will delete your exisiting neovim configuration files!*

Linux:
```sh 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danlikestocode/embervim/main/webinstall.sh && chmod u+x webinstall.sh && ./webinstall.sh
```
## Task List
